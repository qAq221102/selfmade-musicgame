DA is a music game and it stands for danger anyway cuz some reason it is somewhat different from intial mean but still music game
just run DA.py and use US input method then u can try this game and this is a WIP :(
if u wanna import other music, u are recommended to run Preprocess.py and follow the prompt
there are too many technical points have to be overcome ex: audio and video sync, keyboard input, above is basic requirements but they are hard to achieve in py
